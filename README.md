# ExplainAVEC

**Purpose:** Compute feature relevances for the AVEC'17 challenge package

**How to:** Copy and paste `InvestigateBoTW.py` to `<path-to-AVEC-package>/AVEC2017/emotion_baseline_scripts/`

**Dependencies:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, keras, innvestigate

**Caveat**: Ok, janitor will be here soon... Ah, not the house, but the script is little untidy? Yeah, might be, we may clean it up a bit and may even send it for a beauty contest, but more on that later... The code works and is pretty straightforward to understand. But if you have specific queries, need any advice or a documentation, or if you are interested in building on top of this work in any way, please feel free to reach out and we are happy to help and/or collaborate. Stalk us to find our address and send us a snail-mail, or better yet... Let's save you all that trouble, my email address below.
