# ExplainAVEC

**Purpose:** 

Compute BoTW feature relevance scores for the AVEC'17 challenge package (easily extendable to AVEC'18 challenge).

**How to:** 

1. Copy-paste `InvestigateBoTW.py` to `<path-to-AVEC-package>/AVEC2017/emotion_baseline_scripts/`.

2. Open up your favourite python IDE or a terminal. 

3. `python InvestigateBoTW.py`

**Dependencies:** 

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, keras, innvestigate

**Caveat**: 

"Ok, janitor will be here soon... Ah, not house, the script is untidy?! Ok, we may clean it up soon and are even considering sending it for a beauty contest, but oh well..." (We'll keep you posted...) 

In any case, the code here works fine and is (hopefully) easy to understand. :) If you need some advice, tips, documentation, or just interested in building on top of this work in any way, please feel free to reach out. 

We are happy to help and/or collaborate. Stalk us to find our postal address to send us a snail-mail, or wait... Better yet, let's save you all that trouble! Here're my email addresses for this project. Happy coding! :)
