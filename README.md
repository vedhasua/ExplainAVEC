**How to:**

2. Open up your favourite python IDE or a terminal. 

3. `python InvestigateBoTW.py`

**Caveat**: 

Ok, janitor will be here soon... Ah, not the house, but the script is little untidy? Yeah, might be, we may clean it up a bit and are even considering sending it for a beauty contest, but oh well... Will keep you posted.

In any case though, the code here works and is pretty straightforward to understand. If you need any advice or a documentation, or if you are interested in building on top of this work in any way, please feel free to reach out. We are happy to help and/or collaborate. Stalk us to find our postal address to send us a snail-mail, or better yet... Let's save you all that trouble, my email addresses for this project below. Happy coding!
