# ExplainAVEC

**Purpose:** Compute feature relevances for the AVEC'17 challenge package

**How to:** Copy and paste `InvestigateBoTW.py` to `<path-to-AVEC-package>/AVEC2017/emotion_baseline_scripts/`

**Dependencies:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, keras, innvestigate

**Caveat**: Ok, janitor will be here soon... Ah, not the house, but the script is untidy? Yeah, we are still cleaning it up, should be up soon. We are planning on sending it for beauty contest, but more on that letter. The code is pretty straightforward to understand. But if you have specific queries, need a documentation, or if you are interested in building on top of this work in any way, please feel free to reach out and we can help/collaborate. Stalk us to find us and send us a snail mail, or better yet... Let's save you all that trouble, my email address below.
