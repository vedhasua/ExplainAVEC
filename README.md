# ExplainAVEC

**Purpose:** 

Compute feature relevances for the AVEC'17 challenge package

**How to:** 

1. Copy-paste `InvestigateBoTW.py` to `<path-to-AVEC-package>/AVEC2017/emotion_baseline_scripts/`.

2. Open up your favourite python IDE or a terminal. 

3. `python InvestigateBoTW.py`

**Dependencies:** 

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, keras, innvestigate

**Caveat**: 

Ok, janitor will be here soon... Ah, not the house, but the script is little untidy? Yeah, might be, we may clean it up a bit and are even considering sending it for a beauty contest, but oh well... We will keep you posted. 

In any case though, the code here works and is (hopefully) easy to understand. :) But hey, if you need some advice, tips, documentation, or just interested in building on top of this work in any way, please feel free to reach out. 

We are happy to help and/or collaborate. Stalk us to find our postal address to send us a snail-mail, or wait... Better yet, let's save you all that trouble! Here're my email addresses for this project. Happy coding! :)
